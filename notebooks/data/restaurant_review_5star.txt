Yes, Henry does it again! He does it again, and again, and again... Whenever my fiance's mom is in town the first place she wants to go to for dinner is Number5Kitchen. As expected, and well deserved! This is truly one of our favorite restaurants we have ever dined at.

There are definitely busier restaurants in the San Carlos downtown dining strip, but Number5Kitchen is like one of those hidden gems. If you know, you know. There were about three parties dining in when we came on Friday night, and all of us seem to have that silent understanding that yes, this is the place you need to be at!

We got the bolognese and crab pasta on our last visit, but that night we ventured out and got the new autumn salad and the cod. OMG. I feel like I will dream about the autumn salad for the rest of my life. Henry's ideas.. are so perfectly combined in his craft. The autumn salad is living proof of it (aside from the wonderful restaurant in its entirety). Fresh figs, "witch finger" grapes, apples, and a creme fraiche.. I could not get over just how lovely everything blended together. I wanted to savor it and eat it forever. I'm trying to get my fiance to re-make that for us at home but we'll see if he pulls through.

I can't wait to come back once again! I'm even thinking of booking out this place for a private party of some sort.. maybe an engagement party, or my birthday.. whichever, I know it'll be THE choice.
