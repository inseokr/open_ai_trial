During my many restaurant outings in the San Carlos area, never did I know this place was ever here. Drakes restaurant is literally on the corner of El Camino and San Carlos Ave. My better half wanted to try this place for brunch. There appears to be a very good variety of food selection on the menu. My significant other chose the crab Benedict since she's been craving crab for the last week. We saw the Loco Moco on the menu and I decided to make that my choice. Who doesn't like a beef patty with rice and gravy. The restaurant was a mission style decor with a modern flare. I like the high ceiling and the bar being in the center of the restaurant. Service was quick and to the point. Our food came out fast and the presentation was great. At some restaurants, they just throw your food on the plate, but Drakes seem to take pride on the presentation too. My significant other loved her Benedict and Drake's did not skimp on the crab meat. It didn't fair so well with my dish. My Loco Moco was not fully cooked and the gravy and rice was below warm. I was hoping to see my Loco Moco come out piping hot and ready to please. However, that was not the case. My dish was flavorless and needed salt...and I never add salt to my food. It was a let down. On a positive note, the beef was good and had a good crunch to the exterior. Regardless of that, it fell short of my expectations. I still recommend Drakes for its location and food. However, I would try something else next time. Till then, it only gets three stars. The price was rather high for what you get.
