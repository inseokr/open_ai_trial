A terrific analysis of the evolution of totalitarianism in early 20th century Europe. Although at times pedantic, Ms Arendt traces the elements of politics, culture and economics which critically contributed to development of authoritarian states across Europe and, subsequently, the totalitarian regimes of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. She also gives perspective on how those movements evolved from the "mobs" of the 19th century. This in turn provides perspective on present day international political movements and which of them have the elements and characteristics of pre totalitarian movements. Given the ever growing numbers of stateless peoples and refugees, this book is a vital reminder why recent generations instituted declarations of international human rights and why laws were created to accord refugees and the stateless rights under the law in our societies. Without such laws any and all societies risks degenerating into such horror. That said, it was not only racism which gave us totalitarianism, it was also the quest for a classless society. We must remember that path to totalitarianism as well.
