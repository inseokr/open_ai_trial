I've come to this place a handful of times and each time it's been worse than the previous. I've ordered a few drinks from here, as well as food (chilaquiles, salmon hash) and it's been pretty good. My issue with this place is the service.

I've sat at the bar and waited 20 mins or more for a drink or for someone to acknowledge me and my party. The last experience was my last straw.

My partner and I sat at the bar last Sunday on Dec 3 and the first mistake was lipstick on my glass. How many seconds does it take to glance at a glass and see that it's not clean? I didn't receive an apology, just a blank stare from the bartender and a remade drink.

We ordered 2 salmon hash dishes and although it was not a bad dish, my partner's food was frozen on the inside. There is zero excuse for raw/frozen food. That's just lazy. Again, no apology, just a stare and they took the dish away and off the receipt. Every time we come here the service is less personable and subpar. The food is fine (when it's not frozen) but there are other, cleaner, more attentive places in the area to receive brunch/food.
