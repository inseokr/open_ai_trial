Worst customer service. I left a voicemail requesting a reservation for a party of 12. The restaurant texted me back late at night at 10:14 PM that it'd be a prix fixe menu at a minimum $60pp. That's fine. It's a small restaurant and I understand the spend (but not the late text.). After agreeing to the charge requesting for the menu, the restaurant just ghosted me. I followed up with texts and voicemails. Still, no response. Why texted me first then? Very disappointed at the lack of courtesy and high horse. Will not support this business again.
